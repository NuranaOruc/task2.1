   <center><h1> Responsive Layouts Without Bootstrap</h1></center>
    <p class="p1">Layouts Without Bootstrap This is a simple demonstration of organizing different elements without
        bootstrap so that when a browser is resized the elements adjust accordingly . The goal is obviously to be
        completely functional with as simple coding as possible . This means avoiding media queries when possible
        etc. Maybe this is common knowledge for most but as Tm growing and learning , I haven't founda comprehensive
        tutorial on the web with this stuff . So here's my two cents .

    <center><h3>Working With Inline Block </h3></center>
    <p class="p2">Let's say you have a group of objects that are all similar in size and shape . A common scenario would be if you
        had multiple images or icons that you are setting side by side in a row . In our case , we'll use boxes . The
        easiest set - up is to set them in a parent container with text - align : center , to center them and then give
        each element a display : inline or inline - block . FYI , you do have to declare a width in order for this to
        work . Just keeping it real .</p>
